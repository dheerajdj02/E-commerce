# E-commerce
E-commerce build using ReactJs and MondoDB

# Scripts

In the project directory you can run using built-in commands:

### npm start

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### npm test

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
